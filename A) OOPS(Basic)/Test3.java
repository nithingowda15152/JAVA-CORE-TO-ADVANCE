/* How object references work in memory.

 1Ô∏è)Objects live in the heap memory
 2)new Account() creates one object.
 3)Variables like a1 and a2 are references (they hold the address of that object)

 4)When you write a2 = a1;,
  both references point to the same object
  So,changing through one reference (a2) also affects the other (a1)
